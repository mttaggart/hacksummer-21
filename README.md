# HackSummer 21 Curriculum

## Overview

Welcome to the second year of #HackSummer! Just like the first iteration, the objective of HackSummer is provide free, interactive technology training for all curious minds. In 2020, we focused on the Python programming language. This year, we'll be putting on our sysadmin hats and diving into the Linux operating system. That might sound boring, but Linux is a powerful tool. Once mastered, it can become anything you want it to be. A hacker's weapon of choice? Sure. The basis of the next killer app? Absolutely. Even...

The brain of a helicopter on Mars.

To master Linux is to understand fundamental concepts about how computers and networks operate. Investing the time in learning how to set it up and manage it sets you miles ahead of the average technologist.

## Course Prerequisites

Having used a computer before will be helpful, but there are no formal prerequisites for this course. 

## Materials

### Required

1. A hunger for learning!
2. A reasonably modern computer. Doesn't have to be a beast, but at least 8 GB of RAM.
3. An internet connection.
4. [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/)
5. Time to commit to viewing the lectures and attempting the challenges 

## Learning Objectives

### Understandings

By the end of this course, you will understand:

* What Linux is
* How Unix-like operating systems differ from other OSes
* Linux file representations
* Linux file permissions
* Basic networking
* Shell scripting
* Client/server architecture
* Linux security concepts

### Skills

By the end of this course, you will be able to:

* Navigate the Linux filesystem
* Use built-in commands to manipulate Linux via the command line
* Install and configure new services
* Connect to other remote systems to perform administrative tasks
* Write scripts to automate tasks
* Secure systems against common vulnerabilities

## Scenario

You are the Systems Engineer on the _ESV Sagan_, Earth's first space exploration vessel. She and her crew are about to embark on a ten-year tour of the solar system. Because the technology supporting the ship and crew needs to be reliable, adaptable, and easy to maintain. That's why the combined space agencies of the globe chose Linux as the base operating system for the _Sagan_.

From launch to a successful return, the challenge machine simulates tasks necessary during the mission. To help the crew perform their objectives and return safely home, you will have to configure and operate the Linux system onboard the _Sagan_.

## Course Structure:

HackSummer 21 is arranged like a fairly traditional course, except streamed over Twitch and YouTube. Each day, we'll begin by reviewing the challenges from the previous lesson, going over any questions asked either in live chat or the Discord. Then, we'll cover new material with examples and demonstrations to prepare you for the next set of challenges.

## Challenge VM

The _Sagan_ will be simulated by the challenge virtual machine, which will be provided for you to download. Each challenge will unlock the password to the next, aligned with the material covered during the lectures. 

Each challenge will contain a `README.txt` detailing the challenges. There will also be a `test` script that checks that your solution achieved the desired state. Once the test passes, you will be given the password for the next challenge.
